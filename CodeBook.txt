FEATURES
(to be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 


The features selected come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ (not in files). 
These signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then tGyro-XYZ were filtered
(tBodyGyro-XYZ), and the acceleration signal was separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and 
tGravityAcc-XYZ), using another filter. Later, the body acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time 
to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). The magnitude of these three-dimensional signals 
were also calculated (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, 
fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccMag, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. ('-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in 
the X, Y and Z directions.)

The following variables have been estimated from these calculations: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Auto regression coefficients
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors were obtained by averaging the signals, and used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean, tBodyAccMean, tBodyAccJerkMean, tBodyGyroMean, tBodyGyroJerkMean
